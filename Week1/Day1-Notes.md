## 📚 What I Learned

### Offensive vs Defensive Security
- **Offensive (Red Team):** Attacking systems to find vulnerabilities (pentesting, ethical hacking)
- **Defensive (Blue Team):** Protecting systems and detecting attacks (SOC, SIEM, IR)

### Why I Chose Blue Team
- I chose Blue Team because defense is critical for every organization.

### What is a SOC?
- Security Operations Center
- Team that monitors and protects organization 24/7
- Uses tools like SIEM to detect threats
- Investigates security incidents

### What is SIEM?
- Security Information and Event Management
- Collects logs from all systems
- Correlates events to detect threats
- Examples: Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar

### Key Terms Learned
- **IDS/IPS:** Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
- **Firewall:** Controls network traffic
- **Threat Intelligence:** Information about attackers
- **IOC:** Indicators of Compromise

## 🛠️ Tools Setup Today
- VirtualBox 7.x
- Kali Linux 2025.x
