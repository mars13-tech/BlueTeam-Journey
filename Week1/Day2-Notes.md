# Day 2 - Defensive Security & Blue Team Foundations

**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Time Spent:** 4 hours
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## 🎯 What I Accomplished Today
1. ✅ Completed TryHackMe "Intro to Defensive Security" room
2. ✅ Started Cisco course - Module 1 complete
3. ✅ Researched Blue Team careers (watched 2-3 videos)
4. ✅ Practiced 20+ Linux commands in Kali
5. ✅ Created Linux command cheat sheet

## 📚 Key Learnings

### What is Blue Team?
- **Definition:** The defenders (protecting the organization and responding to attacks).
- **Main Goal:** Defend systems, detect threats, respond to incidents
- **Focus Areas:** Prevention, Detection, Response, Recovery

### Blue Team Roles I Learned About

**1. SOC Analyst (Tier 1)**
- Monitors security alerts 24/7
- Investigates suspicious activity
- Uses SIEM tools
- Escalates serious incidents
- **This is my target role!**

**2. Incident Response Analyst**
- Responds to security incidents
- Performs forensic analysis
- Contains and remediates threats

**3. Threat Hunter**
- Proactively searches for threats
- Uses advanced analytics
- Hypothesis-based investigations

### What is a SOC?
- **Security Operations Center**
- Central location where security team works
- Monitors all security tools and alerts
- Works in shifts (24/7 coverage)
- Uses dashboards and SIEM platforms

### Tools Blue Team Uses (That I'll Learn)
1. **SIEM:** Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar
2. **IDS/IPS:** Snort, Suricata
3. **EDR:** CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, Wazuh
4. **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, tcpdump
5. **Forensics:** Autopsy, Volatility, FTK Imager

### Cisco Module 1 - Key Concepts

**Why Cybersecurity Matters:**
- Cybersecurity protects individuals, organizations, and governments from digital attacks by safeguarding networked systems and data from unauthorized access or harm.
- It is essential at a personal level to secure your identity and devices, while for businesses and nations, it preserves reputation, operations, economic stability, and national security.
  
**Types of Threats:**
1. Malicious cyber attacks by intentional actors, such as cybercriminals seeking financial gain or disruption through methods like viruses, worms, and Trojans.
2. Accidental human actions. These occur unintentionally through errors like clicking phishing links, misconfiguring systems, or sharing sensitive data, leading to vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
3. Structural vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or processes. These are inherent design flaws or weaknesses, such as outdated systems or poor configurations, that create exploitable gaps even without malicious intent.

**Cybersecurity Domains:**
- Technical domain: Focuses on securing networks, systems, and data through tools like firewalls and encryption.
- Physical domain: Protects hardware, facilities, and devices from unauthorized access or damage.
- Procedural domain: Involves policies, training, and processes to manage risks and respond to incidents.

### Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
- **Forensics:** Analyzing evidence after an incident
- **Incident Response:** Containing and recovering from attacks
- **Process:** Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned

## 🐧 Linux Commands I Practiced Today

**Navigation:**
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `ls -la` - List all files with details
- `cd` - Change directory

**File Operations:**
- `touch` - Create file
- `cat` - View file contents
- `nano` - Edit files
- `cp` - Copy files
- `mv` - Move/rename files
- `rm` - Delete files

**Useful Commands:**
- `whoami` - Current user
- `ifconfig` - Network info
- `clear` - Clear screen

## 💡 Important Insights

**What I Realized About Blue Team:**
I realized that SOC Analysts are like cyber guardians - they protect organizations 24/7. The work involves detective skills (investigating alerts) and technical skills (using SIEM tools). What excites me most is that this role is in HIGH demand and every company needs SOC analysts.

**Skills I Need to Develop:**
1. SIEM platform expertise (Splunk/ELK)
2. Log analysis skills
3. Threat detection techniques
4. Incident response procedures
5. Linux command line mastery

## 🎯 How This Connects to My 15 LPA Goal

**SOC Analyst roles at 15 LPA require:**
- ✅ Understanding of Blue Team operations (learning this today!)
- ⏳ SIEM skills (starting soon)
- ⏳ Certifications (Cisco in progress)
- ⏳ Projects (will build)
- ⏳ Interview skills (will practice)

**I'm building the foundation today.**

## 💪 Challenges Faced
[Be honest - what was difficult today?]
- Cisco course has a lot of reading, needed to stay focused.

## ✅ What Went Well
[What was easy or enjoyable?]
- TryHackMe room was engaging and interactive

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Goals (Day 3)

**Day 3 Focus: Cyber Kill Chain & Defense**
- Complete "Cyber Kill Chain" room on TryHackMe
- Complete "Unified Kill Chain" room
- Cisco Module 2
- Practice more Linux commands
- Start learning about threat frameworks

## 📊 Stats After Day 2
- **Days Completed:** 2/180
- **TryHackMe Rooms:** 2
